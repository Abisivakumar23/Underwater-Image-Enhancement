# Underwater-Image-Enhancement
Underwater photos provide an important role in safeguarding marine resources, but they are difficult to obtain due to the challenging conditions. A dual method is developed to improve the visibility, color, and natural appearance of underwater images. This approach generates two versions: a natural-looking version for display and a high-contrast one for extracting useful information. In comparison to current methods, the suggested method offers greater color restoration by enhancing quality, contrast, and detail extraction.
